# I-am-new-could-use-tips
### learning how to code and github suggested I make this. 
I'm sure I'll find a use for it soon.
I guess this would be how i *adjust* my code? I can't tell if this is a place to write code or if i would just upload it from vscode or idle or something. I'm starting with **python3** and i'm enjoying it so any other jargon and i might get lost at this time.
